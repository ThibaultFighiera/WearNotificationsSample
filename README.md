# Wear Notifications Sample

## What this project is for?

I have spent time to find out what's possible to do with wear notification.
All samples found in this project are made to work without creating a single line of code on wear side.

## What do you show ?

You will find in this sample application several types of notifications :

* Simple notifaction to settle the bases
* Simple notification with a background image to show how it's displayed on wear
* Specific simple notifications on Wear with [NotificationCompat.WearableExtender](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/NotificationCompat.WearableExtender.html)
* Specific notification with user actions and callback handle with [NotificationCompat.Action](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/NotificationCompat.Action.html)
* Specific notifications with several pages
